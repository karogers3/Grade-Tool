# GradeTool

This application takes numeric grades as inputs and produces the
corresponding letter grades following 
[the triage grading policy](https://www.cs.bsu.edu/~pvgestwicki/misc/grading.shtml).

This project is provided as an example for students to refactor. It
intentionally violates many principles of good programming practice.

##RESUBMISSION MEMO
Unlike the original submission this version:
* Follows [the seven rules of a great Git commit message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)
* Clearly outlines which rule from Clean Code is being violated
* Refactors the test classes
* More comprehensively refactors the production code
* Keeps the url included in the javadoc comment in GradeTool
